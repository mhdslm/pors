# Project Name: Online Clinical Appointment Management System
Project description: This system allows users to register/login as patients or doctors. When logging into the application, the system shows different navigation bar depending on the role of the user. Patients can see list of all doctors in the system and register to them. They can also see list of all doctors that they have registered to. In addition, patients can schedule appointments with their doctors, view list of their appointments and their status, and can unregister from a doctor. Doctors can see all requested appointments on their home page and are able to approve or decline each appointment. After submission of each action by the doctor, an email notification is sent to the patient regarding their appointment.
